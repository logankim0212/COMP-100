 * 10.  Write and run a C# program that calculates and displays the amount of
 * money available in a bank account that initially has $1,000 deposited in it
 * and that earns 8 percent interest a year. Your program should display the
 * amount available at the end of each year for a period of ten years. Use the
 * relationship that the money available at the end of each year equals the
 * amount of money in the account at the start of the year plus .08 times
 * the amount available at the start of the year.
 * Your output should be formatted as shown below
 * Year    Balance
 *  1     $1,080.00
 *  2     $1,166.40
 *  3     $1,259.71
